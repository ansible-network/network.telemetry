# Network Telemetry Validated Content

This repository contains the `network.telemetry` Ansible Collection.

## Description

The `network.telemetry` enables user to manage the Telemetry configuration on networking devices and
also setup a Telegraf - Kafka stack to seemlessly integrate with [Event-Driven Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/use-cases/event-driven-automation).

## Tested with Ansible

Tested with ansible-core >=2.13 releases.

## Installation

#### Prerequisites

The collection requires `network.base:2.0.0` to function.
```
ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.base,2.0.0
```

#### Install `network.telemetry`

```
ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.telemetry
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
- name: https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.telemetry.git
  type: git
  version: main
```

## Capabilities
- `Gather Telemetry Facts`: Gather telemetry facts from network devices and store it as host_vars (locally or remote), enabling the creation of a telemetry source-of-truth on a per target host basis.

- `Manage Telemetry Configuration`: Configure telemetry as a discrete resource on target hosts. Use locally or remotely stored source-of-truth to push (or update) configuration and also detect/remediate drifts.

- `Perform Telemetry Health Checks`: Run health checks to validate the telemetry process running on target hosts. Check for transport connection status, verify data collection statistics for sensor paths, and more.

## Usage

### Gather Telemetry Facts with `action: gather`
- This action "gathers" telemetry configuration from the target host and displays it.

```yaml
- name: Gather telemetry configuration
  hosts: nxos-9k
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Run Telemetry Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.telemetry.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.nxos.nxos
      actions:
        - name: gather
```

### Build Brownfield Inventory with `action: persist`

- Gather telemetry configuration (as structured data) from the target host and build a source-of-truth.
- This action "persists" the gathered telemetry configuration into a flat-file (`telemetry.yaml`) in YAML format.
- By default, this file will be created under `host_vars/{{ inventory_hostname }}/` directory. You can override this
  by setting the `inventory_directory` variable.

```yaml
- name: Persist telemetry configuration as host_vars
  hosts: nxos-9k
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Run Telemetry Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.telemetry.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.nxos.nxos
      actions:
        - name: persist
          inventory_directory: /path/to/inventory
```

### Deploy Telemetry Configuration with `action: deploy`
- This action "deploys" (pushes) telemetry configuration defined in the host_vars (SoT) to the target hosts.

```yaml
- name: Deploy telemetry configuration from host_vars
  hosts: nxos-9k
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Run Telemetry Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.telemetry.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.nxos.nxos
      actions:
        - name: deploy
```

### Perform Telemetry Health Checks with `action: health_check`

```yaml
---
- name: Perform telemetry health checks
  hosts: nxos-9k
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Run Telemetry Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.telemetry.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.nxos.nxos
      actions:
        - name: health_check
          vars:
            checks:
              - name: transport_connected
```

**Supported Health Checks**

|     Health Check    |        Supported For       |
|:-------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| transport_connected |         cisco.nxos         |


### Detect configuration drifts with `action: detect`

- This action "detects" drifts by comparing on-box telemetry configuration with the source-of-truth.

```yaml
- name: Detect drifts in telemetry configuration
  hosts: nxos-9k
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Run Telemetry Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.telemetry.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.nxos.nxos
      actions:
        - name: detect
```

### Remediate configuration drifts with `action: remediate`

- This action "remediates" drifts between on-box telemetry configuration and the source-of-truth.

```yaml
- name: Remediate drifts in telemetry configuration
  hosts: nxos-9k
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Run Telemetry Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.telemetry.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.nxos.nxos
      actions:
        - name: remediate
```

### Deploy a telemetry collector for use with Event-Driven Ansible

- This action builds a containerized Telegraf - Kafka that collects telemetry from network devices.
- The Telegraf container is configured to receives the data on port 57000 and write it to the Kafka topic `eda`.
- The Kafka container is configured to listen for reads/writes on port `9092`.
- An EDA rulebook can then read the telemetry data from this Kafka topic by leveraging the Kafka source plugin
  and take actions.
- Optionally, you can set the `kafka_external_listener` variable to the IP address of the host where these containers
  are deployed. This is required when EDA is running on a different host.

```yaml
- name: Deploy telemetry collector
  hosts: collector01
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:
  - name: Run Telemetry Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.telemetry.run
    vars:
      actions:
        - name: deploy_collector
          kafka_external_listener: 203.0.113.100 # optional
```
**Example Rulebook**

```yaml
- name: Report incident to ServiceNow
  hosts: nxos
  sources:
    - ansible.eda.kafka:
        host: 203.0.113.100
        topic: eda
        port: 9092
  rules:
    - name: Check route count drops
      condition:
        all:
          - event.fields.routeCount < 100
          - event.tags.vrfName == "prod"
      actions:
        - run_playbook:
            name: report_event.yaml
```

### Testing and Development

The project uses tox to run `ansible-lint` and `ansible-test sanity`.
Assuming this repository is checked out in the proper structure,
e.g. `collections_root/ansible_collections/network/telemetry`, run:

```shell
  tox -e ansible-lint
  tox -e py39-sanity
```

To run integration tests, ensure that your inventory has a `network_telemetry` group.
Depending on what test target you are running, comment out the host(s).

```shell
[network_telemetry]
nxos
collector01

[nxos_9k]
nxos

[collectors]
collector01

[nxos_9k:vars]
< enter inventory details for this group >

[collectors:vars]
< enter inventory details for this group >
```

```shell
  ansible-test network-integration -i /path/to/inventory --python 3.9 [target]
```
