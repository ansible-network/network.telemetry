  - summary: "Restructured the network.telemetry collection by converting supported operations into separate roles."
    details: |
      The following changes were made to the `network.telemetry` collection:
      - Converted operations like `gather`,`deploy_collector`, `persist`, `detect`, `remediate`, `deploy` and `health_checks` into individual roles for better modularity and clarity
      - Each role (`persist`, `detect`, `remediate`, `deploy`, `gather`, `health_checks`) now has its own README.md and integration tests
      - Updated all integration tests to align with the new role-based structure
      - Improved documentation and usage examples for each role to reflect the restructuring
    issues:
      - id: "ANA-503"
        type: "feature"
        link: "https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ANA-503"
    impact:
      - "Developers need to update their playbooks to use roles instead of operations"
      - "Test cases and pipelines relying on operations must be updated to reference the new roles"
    role_changes:
      - persist: "Now an independent role for saving telemetry configurations to local or remote data stores"
      - detect: "Now an independent role for identifying telemetry configuration drifts"
      - remediate: "Now an independent role for fixing telemetry configuration drifts by applying saved configurations"
      - deploy: "Now an independent role for deploying telemetry configurations based on inventory host_vars"
      - gather: "New role to collect and display structured facts for telemetry resources"
      - health_checks: "New role to perform health checks on telemetry connectivity and status"
      - deploy_collector: "New role to set up telemetry collection infrastructure using Docker and Telegraf"
